A beautiful offering to our lord and savior Nicolas Cage.
This app is a simple messaging app (I might improve upon later) that showcases the beauty that is our Ghost Rider.
Utilizes FireBase to host email/passowrd registration and allows realtime messaging between two or more parties in 
the same screen (I do want to add 1-to-1 messaging rather than just a large room).

Anyways, fully functional. Tried to push it to the Google Play Store, still pending, probably won't go through,
but ya never know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
